title: "Hello!"

This is only beginning of my little coding blog. How to start this thing? What should be the first topic? I don't know. 

## Who I am? 

Well, I am frontend developer from Ukraine, working in the industry for more than two years. Yeah, this is not a huge experience, but it counts.

## What I want to share with you? 

```
some code herer
```

In my daily work there are things I wish I had known before. And that's what I want to tell you.

Actually, I just want to share my daily experience with technology. This is surely a very opinionated resource, but I will try my very best.
