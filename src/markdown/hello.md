This is only beginning of my little coding blog. How to start this thing? What should be the first topic? I don't know, but I am already excited!

I am frontend developer from Ukraine, working in the industry for more than two years. Yeah, this is not a huge experience, but why not to share it? Without pretending to be an expert voice, I just want to share my daily findings in a world of coding. 

So, thank you for your attention, I hope to see you later here!
